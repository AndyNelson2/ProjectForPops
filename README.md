# ProjectForPops
Trying to create an application similar to Pops' spreadsheet he uses to track issues in patents at work. 
It's a bug/issue tracker that records when an issue when entered in the system, who entered it, what project it was associated with, the severity (as indicated by user), and any supplimentary notes attached with it. 
It also will keep track of which issues a project has have persisted the longest.
